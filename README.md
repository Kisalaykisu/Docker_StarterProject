  Deliver multiple applications hassle free and have them run the same way on all your environments including design, testing, staging and production â€“ desktop or cloud-   native.
   Deploy your applications in separate containers independently and in different languages. Reduce the risk of conflict between languages, libraries or frameworks.
  Speed development with the simplicity of Docker Compose CLI and with one command, launch your applications locally and on the cloud with AWS ECS and Azure ACI.
